Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. 

Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. 

### Main points in Reinforcement learning â€“ 

- **Input:** The input should be an initial state from which the model will start
- **Output:** There are many possible outputs as there are a variety of solutions to a particular problem
- **Training:** The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.
- The model keeps continues to learn.
- The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward.

### Applications of RL :
Various Practical applications of Reinforcement Learning :
 
- RL can be used in robotics for industrial automation.
- RL can be used in machine learning and data processing
- RL can be used to create training systems that provide custom instruction and materials according to the requirement of students.

RL can be used in large environments in the following situations:  

- A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;
- Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization)
- The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it.
