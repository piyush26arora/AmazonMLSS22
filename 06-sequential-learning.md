# [Sequential Learning](https://analyticsindiamag.com/a-tutorial-on-sequential-machine-learning/)
Everything in life depends on time and therefore, represents a sequence. To perform machine learning with sequential data (text, speech, video, etc.) we could use a regular neural network and feed it the entire sequence, but the input size of our data would be fixed, which is quite limiting. Other problems with this approach occur if important events in a sequence lie just outside of the input window. What we need is (1) a network to which we can feed sequences of arbitrary length one element of the sequence per time step (for example a video is just a sequence of images; we feed the network one image at a time); and (2) a network which has some kind of memory to remember important events which happened many time steps in the past. These problems and requirements have led to a variety of different recurrent neural networks.

## **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) :**

Long short-term memory (LSTM) units use a linear unit with a self-connection with a constant weight of 1.0. This allows a value (forward pass) or gradient (backward pass) that flows into this self-recurrent unit to be preserved indefinitely (inputs or errors multiplied by 1.0 still have same value; thus, the output or error of the previous time step is the same as the output for the next time step) so that the value or gradient can be retrieved exactly at the time step when it is needed most. This self-recurrent unit, the memory cell, provides a kind of memory which can store information which lies dozen of time-steps in the past. This is very powerful for many tasks, for example for text data, an LSTM unit can store information contained in the previous paragraph and apply this information to a sentence in the current paragraph.

Additionally, a common problem in deep networks is the “vanishing gradient” problem, where the gradient gets smaller and smaller with each layer until it is too small to affect the deepest layers. With the memory cell in LSTMs, we have continuous gradient flow (errors maintain their value) which thus eliminates the vanishing gradient problem and enables learning from sequences which are hundreds of time steps long.

However, sometimes we want to throw away information in the memory cell and replace it with newer, more relevant information. At the same time, we do not want to confuse the rest of the network by releasing unnecessary information into the network. To solve this problem, the LSTM unit has a forget gate which deletes the information in the self-recurrent unit without releasing the information into the network (see Figure 1). In this way, we can throw away information without causing confusion and make room for a new memory. The forget gate does this by multiplying the value of the memory cell by a number between 0 (delete) and 1 (keep everything). The exact value is determined by the current input and the LSTM unit output of the previous time step.

At other times, the memory cell contains a   that needs to be kept intact for many time steps. To do this LSTM adds another gate, the input or write gate, which can be closed so that no new information flows into the memory cell (see Figure 1). This way the data in the memory cell is protected until it is needed.

Another gate manipulates the output from the memory cell by multiplying the output of the memory cell by a number between 0 (no outputs) and 1 (preserve output) (see Figure 1). This gate may be useful if multiple memories compete against each other: A memory cell might say “My memory is very important right now! So I release it now!” but the network might say: “Your memory is important, true, but other memory cells have much more important memories than you do! So I send small values to your output gate which will turn you off and large values to the other output gates so that the more important memories win!”

The connectivity of an LSTM unit may seem a bit complicated at first, and you will need some time to understand it. However, if you isolate all the parts you can see that the structure is essentially the same as in normal recurrent neural networks, in which inputs and recurrent weights flow to all gates, which in turn are connected to the self-recurrent memory cell.
